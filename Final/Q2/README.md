Use the knowledge you have learned in week1, week2, and week 3 to obtain
1. Run single point calculations on hydrogen atom using the PBE functional with Pople's basis sets, sto-3g, 3-21g, 4-31g, 6-31g, 6-311g with Pyscf
2. Show that the SIE becomes less severe with larger basis sets with a plot of SIE vs basis set.
3. Show that electronic energy converges to the theoretical value, -0.5 Eh, with a plot of E_ele vs basis set. 
4. Run geometry optimization of a CO molecule using BP86 and the def2-SVP basis set using Orca 4.2.
5. Use the optimized geometry to run single point calculations using BP86 and a hierarchy of def2 basis sets, def2-SVP, def2-TZVP, and def2-QZVPP with the option ! normalprint chelpg hirshfeld
6. Show that the four commonly employed charge analyses, Mulliken, Loewdin, chelpg, and Hirshfeld, Hirshfeld is the most stable one with respect to basis set charge (not necessarily the most accurate).

Ans:

2. Plot
3. Plot
4. Plot
