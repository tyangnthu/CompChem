Use the knowledge you have learned in week0 to obtain statistics about the files in files_to_clean_up.zip
1. unzip the zip file.
2. count files that contain Sc, Ti, V, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, or Cu.
3. make a histogram of the distribution of the number of atoms of the structures
4. For ADOKUB.xyz, remove the solvents and replace the R groups on NHC (the C1=CN[C]N1 unit) and those on the phenyl anion with H.
5. Optimize the generated structure with the def2-svp basis set with the bp86 functional along with the semi-empirical dispersion correct d3.
